# Abstract
The global financial system sits on vast untapped asset equity while increasingly relying on fiat issuance, fueling inflation and instability. Value should flow from assets, not to them.  

Stable proposes an asset-based financial system, using a medium of exchange backed by real-world value. Advances in AI and real-time monitoring enable increasingly precise asset valuation, making large-scale implementation more feasible each year.  

Real estate is the ideal starting pointâ€”globally traded, deeply embedded in finance, yet largely untapped in equity. Stable aims to dissolve that complexity, unlocking its true value.
